weak isolation levels why: string isolation level (I in the ACID) is expensive and sometimes not necessary in biz model what: read committed, repeatable read, read uncommitted, etc... intro to read committed what: txn can only read & overwrite committed data value (no dirty read/write: modified but not committed value) still cannot avoid many concurrent scenarios: concurrent increment counters, long running txns, etc. implement read committed prevent dirty write: row-level locks prevent dirty read: DB remembers old committed value and new value. switching over to new value if committed. snapshot isolation scenario: long running snapshot operation: need to read many data from DB read committed level does not work here as other txn starts and commits. the snapshot reads data from different time. this is called as **non-repeatable read**/**read skew**, if the snapshotting txn read the value twice, it may see different values what we want: the snapshotting txn should just read the snapshot while other txns working under such level, a **consistent snapshot** of the DB will be read it's very popular, and supported by MySQL(InnoDB), PostgreSQL...
