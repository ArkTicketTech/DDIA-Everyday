### Cloud Computing and Supercomputing

Large scale computing
- High-performance computing (HPC)  weather forecasting/molecular dynamic
- Cloud computing: multi-tenant datacenter, commodity computer connected with IP network, elastic resource allocation and metered billing
- Traditional enterprise datacenter

Supercomputer: one node fails, stop cluster, replace, restart from checkpoint

Internet service
- application are online, stopping is not acceptable (unlike whether simulation
- Supercomputer: specialized hardware. Cloud: same performance at lower cost, higher failure rate
- Supercomputer: specialized network.
- The bigger the system, the higher the chance of things breaking. Large system can't afford stop everytime things break
- It's useful feature that system can tolerate failed node and keep working
- Geo-distributed deployment, communication through internet is slow and unreliabale compared to local networks.

Need to consider wide range of possible faults and create such situations for testing.d
