Reality issues

Problem with network
clock and timing

Faults and Partial Failures

Hardware issue -> total system failure
With good software: either fully functional or entirely broken

Idealized system model: If internal fault occurs, prefer crash over the wrong result

Distributed systems are different: no idealized system model.
partical failure, nondeterministic
