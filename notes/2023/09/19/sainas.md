### Building a Reliable System from Unreliable Components

#### Is it possible?
System can only be as reliable as the "weakest link"
This is not true

Examples
- Error correcting code in digital data transmition: can fix some wrong bits
- IP is unreliable, (drop/reorder package) TCP is more reliable

But always has a limit
Error correcting: only small portion
TCP: can not remove delays
