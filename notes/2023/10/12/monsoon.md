Intro to Azure fundamentals

Azure is a cloud computing platform, supports services from simple to complex
	- Simple web services for holding websites
	- Virtual machines, databases
	- AI, IoT..

Cloud Computing: delivery of computing/storage services over the Internet
Shared Responsibility Model: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, On-prem
Customer: 1. Data 2. Endpoint devices 3. Account & Subscription management
Cloud: 1. physical datacenter 2. physical network 3. physical hosts
Optional: 1. OS 2. Network controls 3. Applications 4. Identity and infrastructure

Cloud models:
	1. Private cloud: developed & owned by a single company/entity. Used privately by owner
	2. Public cloud:  developed & owned by a cloud provider. Used publicly by customers
	3. Hybrid cloud: both private and public in a inter-connected env. Some apps run on public and some on private
	4. (growing) Multi-cloud: services built with multiple cloud providers (Azure and AWS)
Azure Arc is a tool to help manage these models

Consumption-based model
Two types of expenses for IT infra
	- Capital Expenditure (CapEx): purchase things, like machines, devices, building a datacenter
	- Operation Expenditure (OpEx): renting things, instead of buying
Cloud computing cost is mainly OpEx. Customers only pay for IT services rented, not buying IT infra.
