## Simplicity
 What is complexity?
 * tangled dependencies
 * explosion of the state space
 * tight coupling of modules


 Why do we need to avoid complexity?
 * more potential bugs
 * hard maintenance
 * more easily overlook hidden assumptions, unintended consequences

 What do we need to do for simplicity?
 * Abstraction!

 ## Evolvability
 * Systems won't remain unchanged.
 * Agile: TDD, refactoring, ...

 ## Summary
 - Application requirements: functional and nonfunctional
 - reliability: fault-tolerance (hardware? software? humans?)
 - scalability: describe load and perf
 - maintainability: good abstractinos, good operability

 # Data Models and Query Languages
 The key question of data modelling: how is it represented in terms of the next-lower layer?

 ## Relational Model vs. Document Model
 - The mismatch between OOP languages and relational tables
 - ORM frameworks cannot perfectly solve this
